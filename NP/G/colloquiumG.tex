    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Yes, if java is executed with the \textit{-ea} flag which enables Assertions and the Exception is not handled.
        \item No, this behavior would involve too much overhead.
        \item No, not in the Bytecode
        \item No, comments dont have any semantic ;)
        \item Yes, \textit{await} just continues if it gets notified.
        \item No, Linked Listed have to be monitors aswell.
        \item Not really, \textit{synchronized} can be applied almost as flexible, the only problem is that only one lock per object is used.
        \item Yes 
        \item Yes, because multiple locks allow for more concurrency and potentially less lock blocking 
        \item Yes, they are sequential in the \textit{synchronized} block.
        \item Not always, only if you can ensure that \textit{notify} is called after \textit{wait}. 
        \item Yes, safety violations can be found in finite executions and liveness problem only appear in infinite executions.
        \item No, see the above
        \item No, \textit{run()} is a sequential function which you can execute concurrently with \textit{Thread.start()}
        \item Yes
        \item Yes, \textit{wait()} stops execution.
        \item Yes, \textit{notifyAll()} would be correct.
        \item No, you can only make methods and blocks synchronized.
        \item What is incorrect? But the signal call may valid, but the functionality may be impaired.
        \item Yes.
        \item No, it's a correctness property (finite).
        \item False, liveness 
        \item No, it only sets the boolean flag \textit{interrupted} (fetchable with \textit{isInterrupted()})
        \item Yes
    \end{enumerate}
    \section{TG-2}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Monitor pseuCo -> explicit locks Java
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item Replace \textit{monitor X} in pseuCo with \textit{class X} in Java.
            \item Add a \textit{private final}  intantice-wise lock $l$ in Java.
            \item Replace condition $c$ with $b$ in pseuCo with \textit{private final $c$ = l.newCondition()} in Java.
            \item Add lock at beginning of every function(wrapped in a try) and an unlock in the final block.
            \item Replace waitForCondition($c$) in pseuCo with while ($!b$) c.await(); in Java
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Explicit locks Java -> Implicit Locks Java
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item remove explicit lock
            \item Replace locking and unlocking with the \textit{synchronized} keyword in the function definition.
            \item Replace c.await with wait();
            \item Replace signal[All] with notify[All].
            \item Add some kind of indication which was condition should be the one that was triggered.
            \item Enjoy :)
